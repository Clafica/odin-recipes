        <h2>A delicous broccoli salad with sweet and savory elements .</h2>
        <p>Broccoli salad is one of my favorite side dishes. Itâ€™s perfect for serving alongside Easter dinner and is a simple and refreshing side dish for summer parties and pot lucks. It can be thrown together in under fifteen minutes and I guarantee you that at least one person is going to ask for the recipe, wherever you bring it.</p>
